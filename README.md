# transperth-tracker
A very simple self-hostable site that slowly tracks trains currently scheduled on the Transperth network.

## How to Install
1. Download the files and pop them into a new folder located somewhere easily accessable via:
   - Command Prompt for Windows
     OR
   - Terminal for MacOS
2. ENSURE you have a version of Node installed on your computer. (I have tested with v18 and Higher)
3. Open the new folder you made in your terminal of choice and initiate the files:
   `npm init -y` (This creates your package.json instantly)
   `npm i express node-cron puppeteer` (This will install the dependencies required to run the server)
   `node .` (This runs the server)

Any issues can be reported via the Issues section on GitHub, or you can add my Discord and ask me further questions: `@.trainguy`.

## Looks a bit ugly...
Yes I 100% understand it looks very ugly at the moment, however, it functions exactly how it should.
